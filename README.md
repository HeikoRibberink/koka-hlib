# Hlib
("Heiko's library" or "Helper library" for Koka)

This library contains some essential utilities for Koka that can be used across projects, and is therefore gradually developed with each project that I build in Koka.

Each sublibrary has its own goal, and therefore contains its own description. Check those out to see what you need.
